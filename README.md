# 🧠 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights using statistical and visual methods.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for step-by-step analysis and visualizations

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Used `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()` for initial data overview
   - Identified and handled missing values

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution plots of Age, Fare, Pclass, Sex, Embarked
   - Count plots for categorical features

3. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Survival analysis by Gender, Class, Embarkation port
   - Boxplots of Age & Fare with respect to survival

4. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Correlation heatmap of numeric features
   - Pairplot of key numerical variables

5. **Observations & Insights**
   - Summarized meaningful trends (e.g., gender-based survival, class influence, fare correlations)

## 📈 Key Findings

- Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive than those in 2nd or 3rd class.
- Passengers who paid higher fares had better survival chances.
- Younger passengers showed slightly higher survival rates.
- Embarkation port 'C' (Cherbourg) had the highest survival rate among ports.
